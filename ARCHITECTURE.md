# LLM-Grok Architecture

## Overview
The llm-grok plugin uses a modular architecture designed for enterprise-grade reliability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Core Components

### Model Class (`grok.py`)
Central orchestrator that coordinates all other components. Implements the LLM plugin interface and manages the request/response lifecycle.

### HTTP Client (`client.py`)  
Enterprise-grade HTTP client with:
- Connection pooling for efficiency
- Circuit breakers for resilience
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting compliance
- SSRF protection

### Format Converters (`formats/`)
Handles API format conversions between:
- OpenAI-compatible format (default)
- Anthropic-compatible format (/messages endpoint)

### Content Processors (`processors/`)
Specialized processors for different content types:
- **Multimodal**: Image validation and format conversion
- **Streaming**: SSE parsing and response streaming
- **Tools**: Function calling and tool response handling

### Type System (`types.py`)
Comprehensive type definitions using TypedDict for:
- API request/response structures
- Model capability definitions
- Configuration options

### Exception Hierarchy (`exceptions.py`)
Comprehensive error handling with specific exceptions for:
- Rate limiting and quota issues
- API errors and network problems
- Validation and conversion errors
- Authentication and authorization

## Design Principles

### Separation of Concerns
Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility.

### Type Safety
Extensive use of TypedDict and type hints for reliability.

### Enterprise Features
- Thread-safe shared resource management
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Performance optimizations

### Extensibility
Modular design allows easy addition of new models, formats, or processors.
