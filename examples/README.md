# LLM-Grok Examples and Educational Resources

This directory contains alternative implementations and educational materials for understanding the llm-grok plugin architecture.

## Contents

### `consolidated_plugin.py`
A complete, single-file implementation of the llm-grok plugin (~500 lines) provided for educational purposes.

**Use Cases:**
- Understanding core plugin logic without modular complexity
- Learning how LLM plugins work
- Quick prototyping and experimentation
- Reference for building similar plugins

**Key Features:**
- All functionality in one file
- Simplified error handling
- Direct API integration
- Clear, readable code flow

**Limitations vs. Production:**
- No connection pooling or circuit breakers
- Basic error handling vs. comprehensive exception hierarchy
- No specialized processors for different content types
- Limited type safety compared to modular version

### When to Use Each Implementation

**Use the Production Implementation** (`llm_grok/` package) when:
- Building production applications
- Need enterprise-grade reliability features
- Want comprehensive error handling
- Require advanced multimodal processing
- Need thread-safe shared resource management

**Study the Educational Implementation** (`examples/consolidated_plugin.py`) when:
- Learning how LLM plugins work
- Understanding the core logic flow
- Building your own similar plugin
- Need a simple reference implementation

## Installation and Usage

The examples are not installed as part of the package. To experiment with the consolidated version:

```python
# Copy consolidated_plugin.py to your project
# Modify the plugin registration to avoid conflicts
# Use for educational purposes only
```

## Contributing

When contributing to the main package, focus on the modular implementation in `llm_grok/`. The consolidated example should only be updated to reflect major API changes.
